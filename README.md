# NonPreemptive-SJFPriority-OperatingSystem
Operating System is an interface between the software and hardware part of any electronic gadget. The OS (Operating System) play an important role in Scheduling, allocating the processes to the CPU to for the execution of functions. The Shortest Job First algorithm deals with the execution of less time taking processes to execute first. In this case if a time taking process enters the scenario much earlier, it keeps on waiting until processes having lesser execution time are completed. Sometimes there is a requirement of Non-Pre-emptive, which means that the processes once started cannot be interrupted by any other process until the process is completed. So, taking the all the things into consideration the software solution is given using the concept of priority.
